Data Structure Implementation in Python and Go

Algorithms and data structures are fundamental to efficient code and good software design. Creating and designing excellent algorithms is required for being an exemplary programmer. 

Under the influence of [WilliamFiset's Youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDV1Zeh2NRsB6SWUrDFW2RmDotAfPbeHu) and his implementation [repo](https://github.com/williamfiset/algorithms), I decided to create a repo for personal active learning to demonstrate how to correctly implement common data structures and algorithms in the simplest and most elegant ways.
